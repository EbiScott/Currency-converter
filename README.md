# Realtime Currency Converter

This Python script utilizes the `forex_python` library to perform real-time currency conversion. It prompts the user to input the original currency, final currency, and amount, and then calculates and displays the converted amount.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter.git
   cd currency-converter

# Install Dependencies:
    pip install forex-python

## Run the Script:

    python currency_converter.py


## Follow the Prompts:
    
    Enter the original currency (e.g., USD, EUR).
    
    Enter the final currency (e.g., JPY, GBP).
    
    Enter the amount to convert.
    
**View the Result:**
    
    The script will display the converted amount.

## Example
    
    Enter the original currency: USD
    
    Enter the final currency: EUR
    
    Enter the amount: 1000

**Output:**
    1000 USD is equal to 870.00 EUR

## Notes
Make sure to handle errors gracefully, such as invalid currencies or network issues during conversion.
